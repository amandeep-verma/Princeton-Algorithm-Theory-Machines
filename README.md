# Princeton-Algorithm-Theory-Machines

The repository contains the course work homework and extras from **Coursera** course - [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines) by Princeton University
In order to execute the programs you would need to setup IDE intellij [mac](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/mac/) and [windows](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/windows/).
To compile and run the programs you would use javac-introcs filename.java and java-introcs filename respectively.
